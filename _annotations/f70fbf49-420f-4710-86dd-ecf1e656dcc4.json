When I became an independent leader of a whaler group in 1796, I decided to create this document. However, because I was still inexperienced, I tried to learn the whaling business by becoming a group master (Danna), a manager (Shihainin), a representative (Mokudai), and moreover, sometimes engaged as a warehouse manager (Nayanin), a harpooner (Hazashi), and a seaman. I just jotted down what I learned, heard, and witnessed. Although it was rather difficult to describe the content accurately, I recorded it down. Harpooners rise at around 4 AM, and then painstakingly perform their assigned duties getting the boats ready to launch. This process was called \u201cYamami.\u201d Whales swim as they wish in the vast Ocean. Spouts are like mist and when harpooners spot the spouts from a mountain, they hurry down, jump into a ship, check around from right to left, and hurriedly launch several boats together. Captains stand up waving their batons, position their ships, and wait for whales. When the boats are pursuing whales, the captain waves a baton from his ship, has whaling nets spread, and sends a signal again to proceed. And then pounding the ship rails, pursuing whales into the nets. At that very moment, an initial harpoon (Hayamori), and then a heavy harpoon (Yorozumori) is thrown. After that, swords are used fiercely. Within 4 or 5 cho (=four city blocks) areas are turning deep red. It is indescribable to capture how whales scream and struggle, however, it is well worth documenting the scenes (here in the scroll?)\n\nCopied on May 1819\n\nGengai (sign)\n",
